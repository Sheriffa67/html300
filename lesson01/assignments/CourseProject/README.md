Topic: A local soccer team

Reason: I want to create a professional looking website, that is mobile friendly, tablet friendly, and viewable and accessible for everyone. This is an opportunity for me to hone my web development skills and build a robust portfolio.

The API I am planning to use is FIFA data and other soccer data around the world to keep my customer engaged. 

By creating a website that is viewable in many platforms with data that is relevant to soccer fans in my communities, I hope to be the go-to for local web development project.
